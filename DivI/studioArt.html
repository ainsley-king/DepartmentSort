      <h1>Studio Art</h1>
      <h4><a href="../index.html">Home</a></h4>
      <h4>Media taught include drawing, oil painting, photography and moving image, ceramics, and hot glass. The major in studio art culminates in an exhibition held in the gallery of the Jones Visual Arts Center at the end of the student’s senior year.</h4>
      <p>Virtually every course in the art program also enrolls students from a broad variety of other disciplines. Students take art courses in search of parallels among the visual arts to other forms of human expression — anthropological, dramatic, historical, literary, and musical — both past and present, or merely with a wish to complement their other undergraduate experiences in the liberal arts by grasping more fully the bases of aesthetic meaning and judgment.</p>

          <td>The Jones Visual Arts Center is equipped with an outstanding studio facility with ample space for creating ceramics. Our firing options rival those offered at any large university. Courses are designed for students to pursue their aesthetic sensibilities within the structure of specific assignments. In our studios, technical knowledge is coupled with creative intent.</td>
          <td>Direct observation is emphasized as students work in a variety of media: charcoal, graphite, pastels, and oil paint. Students develop the ability to draw what they see and turn that into pictures, learning perspective, modeling with light and shade, and the principles of design. Intermediate and advanced students devote particular attention to studying the human figure and anatomy.</td>
          <td>The combination of excellent instruction and hours of hands-on learning make the Centre glass experience one of the best in the nation. The glass-blowing studio, complete with an observation area, is the only facility of its kind in the region.</td>
          <td>The curriculum incorporates the history of photography, video, and cinema; exposure to a wide range of photographic, video, and film artists; technical instruction; brainstorming and creativity exercises; and frequent critiques. Students work with professional-level equipment, hardware, and software to develop motion pictures and create photographic prints.</td></tr></table>

     <td><img src="../pics/HP/Jia_Judith.jpg"></td>
        <td><p>Judith Pointer Jia is H. W. Stodghill, Jr. and Adele H. Stodghill professor of art at Centre College where she has taught since 1998. She received a Kirk Teaching Excellence award in 2016. As the head of the ceramics studio, Jia teaches all levels of ceramics as well as introductory drawing classes. Her experience teaching both drawing and ceramics extends back to graduate school at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth where she was awarded instructor of record positions in both areas.</p>

            <p>Jia’s artwork is created from fine porcelain and stoneware. Her forms are delicate slab constructions that are often closed and seem full of air. A variety of subtly colored glazes and stains envelop the forms. Her work has been chosen for exhibition and won awards in several national competitions including Prevailing Winds, Current Trends in Contemporary American Ceramics, at Young and Constantin Gallery in Wilmington, Vt., and the Wichita National All Media Craft Exhibit, at the Wichita Center for the Arts. A piece was recently shown at the Gaolin International Biennial Ceramic Exhibition at the Jingdezhen Ceramic Institute in China. She regularly exhibits her work at the Ann Tower Gallery in Lexington, Ky., and the Kentucky Museum of Art + Design in Louisville.</p>

            <p>In 2004, Jia was awarded an Al Smith Fellowship from the Kentucky Arts Council which she used to fund travels in China. There she visited cities noted for their history of ceramic production, touring old kiln sites and contemporary artist’s studios. She also spoke with ceramic scholars with expertise in the ceramics of the Song and Yuan dynasties, eras whose ceramics Jia has long admired for their elegant forms and glazes. Jia is also the coordinator of the AEGON Gallery, which is on campus.</p></td>

Her photographs have been exhibited throughout the United States including a solo show at the Center for Photography in Woodstock, N.Y.

     <th>Sheldon Tapley</th>
     <td><img src="../pics/QZ/Tapley_Sheldon.jpg"></td>
         <td><p>Sheldon Tapley was born in Maracaibo, Venezuela to British parents. He was raised in Europe and North America. He has taught at Centre College since 1983, and held the Paul L. Cantrell Professorship of Art from 2002-2005. In 2005 he was named Stodghill Professor of Art. He received the Kirk Award for excellence in teaching in 2015.</p>

             <p>Tapley is a nationally recognized artist whose paintings are held in museum, academic, corporate, and private collections across the United States. In the spring of 2004, the Evansville Museum of Art presented a major retrospective exhibit of Tapley’s art, displaying thirty of his still-life works from the last ten years. American Artist magazine published one of his large still-life paintings on its cover in November 1999 along with a feature article inside. In that article the writer asserts that Tapley “masterfully blends hard-earned classical technique with a vision that is thoroughly modern and personal.” The New Yorker reviewed his 1998 show at Tatistcheff Gallery in New York City, commenting that the “works are intelligently composed and executed with polished skill.”</p>

             <p>At the beginning of his career in the early 1980s, Tapley was a printmaker and abstractionist working with bold colors and textures. Gradually, he returned to the direct observation that made his first experiences in art exciting. A desire to describe his own surroundings led him to paint the landscape, making modern realist images that won wide praise in a series of exhibitions at Linda Schwartz Gallery. In the mid-90’s, the artist changed his focus again, creating the energetic still-life images for which he is now known. The artist was honored with a 1998 Al Smith Fellowship from the Kentucky Arts Council. Kentucky Educational Television featured the artist in its 2001 series “Looking at Painting.” He was filmed and interviewed in his studio and also at the Speed Museum in Louisville, discussing the museum’s recent acquisition, a still-life painting by Cezanne. In 2003, the Owensboro Museum of Fine Art exhibited a selection of his works from the past twelve years.</p>

             <p>Tapley continues to exhibit at Tatistcheff Gallery, located in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. He regularly speaks at art events and judges competitive exhibitions. A Phi Beta Kappa graduate holding a 1980 B.A. from Grinnell College, Tapley received an M.F.A. from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln in 1983.</p></td>
