          <h4>The perspectives and skills acquired by students in politics classes will serve them in a wide range of career fields, including business, journalism, law, politics, and public service.</h4>
          <p>The Politics Program is designed to assist students in developing the arts of deliberation and judgment by which they may understand more fully and participate more effectively in public affairs. Analytical reasoning, effective writing, and proficiency in basic research techniques are skills cultivated and used throughout the program.</p>
<p>Emphasis is placed not so much on the changing details of current events, but on the philosophical, historical, and institutional nature of the persistent problems that current issues illustrate. Students can anticipate a rigorous inquiry into political philosophy, American government, comparative government, and international relations. Students are offered a diversity of non-classroom learning experiences. The Politics Program encourages independent study, internships, and off-campus academic programs.</p>

              <td>Many politics majors participate in Centre’s programs in China, England, France, Japan, or Mexico. All provide exceptional opportunities to observe politics and government in a different setting. Other possibilities for off-campus study also exist, either sponsored by the College — CentreTerm courses in Italy, Vietnam, and Cameroon are recent examples — or through other institutions. The Centre-in-Washington Internship Program allows students to earn a full term’s credit while working and studying in the nation’s capital.</td>
              <td>Politics students have availed themselves of internships in and around Danville and elsewhere in the country. These have included positions in local, state, and national government as well as in the private sector. Examples include working with U.S. Senators and Representatives, the Governor of Kentucky, state and federal courts, and local trial attorneys.</td>
              <td>Politics majors develop reading, writing, speaking, and analytical skills that are useful in a variety of careers. Most of them they tend to gravitate toward careers that deal with public issues and people. Law school is a popular destination for politics majors. There is also interest in graduate programs — both traditional political science programs and specialized programs (public policy, public administration, international relations, communications, and journalism, for example). Others have gone directly from Centre into careers in government, the private sector, a political party, or an interest-group organization.</td></tr></table>
