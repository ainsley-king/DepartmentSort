          <h4>The economics & finance program at Centre integrates the theory of finance with a broad background in economics within a liberal arts educational philosophy.</h4>
          <p>The program encourages majors to consider course work or minors in computer science, history, mathematics, modern foreign languages, philosophy, and social studies. It is strongly recommended that students who are interested in international economics participate in a Centre College off-campus program.</p>
      <p>The economics curriculum has four goals:</p>
 <ol>     
     <li>Competence in the fundamentals of economic theory;</li>
     <li>Capability in quantitative and communication tools for economic analysis and presentation;</li>
     <li>Familiarity with economic processes, policies, and institutions; and</li>
     <li>Acquaintance with critical perspectives on both economic theory and institutions.</li></ol>

<p>Within this framework, students can assemble courses to highlight concentrations in finance, international economics, and policy analysis, and to prepare for graduate programs in business, economics, law, and public policy among others.</p>
